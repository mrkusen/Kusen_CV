	abstract = {Community Led Monitoring (CLM) shifts the dynamic of monitoring from HIV service providers to monitoring led by the people using the services. In order to build an evidence-base for CLM, the Global Fund supported Sustainability of HIV Services for Key Populations in Asia (SKPA-2) program has developed the ``Sustainable Community-led Monitoring of HIV Services Toolkit for Key Populations ``. This provides a framework, indicators, and guidance on how to ensure the CLM process is community-led and guided through measurable bottom-up approaches.
Description: Launched in 2022, the CLM toolkit has been piloted in Mongolia, Bhutan and Sri Lanka for key population groups including men who have sex with men, transwomen, sex workers, people living with HIV, and people who use drugs. The toolkit provides a framework of 8 core indicators to monitor Availability, Accessibility, Acceptability, and Quality (AAAQ) along with 5 indicators to measure and ensure there is follow-up for those experiencing stigma, discrimination, and/or violence. The selection of final indicators, pilot sites, data processes and follow-up should be decided by CLM technical working group made up of national stakeholders and includes key population representatives.

Helped identify the type of facilities where stigma and discrimination (S&D) was more prevalent to support more targeted efforts to reduce S&D in healthcare settings.
Supported the identification of the type of services with the least availability including CD4 count and viral load testing.
CLM data should be designed to share data visually and in an easy to digest manner to community groups such as through electronic dashboards. Funding for CLM is not assured as health programs also have their own feedback systems, so community led models need to be cost-effective. Identified the need to include well managed referral mechanisms to accountability mechanisms to manage and deal with experiences of S&D when accessing HIV services.

The CLM toolkit helps provide interesting findings for other countries when designing and rolling out CLM. Future research and programs may include an evaluation to assess the impact CLM has on supporting countries to improve service quality and achieve their 95-95-95 targets as well as the sustainability of CLM funding.},
